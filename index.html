       <!-- About Me -->
       <div class="about me">
         <h2>About Me</h2>
           <p class="about-me">My name is Finneas Scott and I am currently taking my second year of courses at Florida Gulf Coast University and am residing in Fort Myers, Florida.  I am pursuing a major in Mathematics with a minor in Physics.  I am also a high school graduate from Gulf Coast High School and was at University of South Florida for a year.  My experience with math includes Introduction to Computer Science, Calculus 1, Precalculus, College Algebra, Physics 1 Honors, and Advanced Topics in Math.  I have volunteered at the Collier County Domestic Animal Services assisting in taking care of the animals at the facility and helping the workers there for nearly 100 hours. </p>
           <p class="about-me">Some of my work includes making this portfolio website for myself and making a game in the program Scratch.  I have also been taking Codecademy learning computer programming such as HTML, CSS, and Java Script.  I have also tutored kids for math problems and other school work they may have trouble with.  Other experiences I have computing hardware and software that are used such as Base 8 and Pep/8.  I have a basic understanding of programming but, I am a fast learner and can solve problems quickly when learing something new.</p>
