         <h2>About Me</h2>
           <p class="about-me">My name is Finneas Scott and I am currently taking my second year of courses at Florida Gulf Coast University and am residing in Fort Myers, Florida.  I am pursuing a major in Mathematics with a minor in Physics.  I am also a high school graduate from Gulf Coast High School and was at University of South Florida for a year.  My experience with math includes Introduction to Computer Science, Calculus 1, Precalculus, College Algebra, Physics 1 Honors, and Advanced Topics in Math.  I have volunteered at the Collier County Domestic Animal Services assisting in taking care of the animals at the facility and helping the workers there for nearly 100 hours. </p>
           <p class="about-me">Some of my work includes making this portfolio website for myself and making a game in the program Scratch.  I have also been taking Codecademy learning computer programming such as HTML, CSS, and Java Script.  I have also tutored kids for math problems and other school work they may have trouble with.  Other experiences I have computing hardware and software that are used such as Base 8 and Pep/8.  I have a basic understanding of programming but, I am a fast learner and can solve problems quickly when learing something new.</p>

           <p class="notes">The sounds that I made are the steps and death sound and formatted them through MP3.  MP3 is the most common format around for sound as it saves space on computers while also sounding similar to the original recording.  The MP3 has a lossless compression while the WAV format, is uncompressed .  The steps were created by slapping my desk and the death sound came from my voice. </p>
           <p class="notes">All the backdrops and the sprites were created through graphics provided in Scratch and I used the the bitmap and vector graphic format.  Vector formats represent the image by lines and shapes and raster graphics stores the image pixel by pixel.  I created the background by painting the background and then using blocks for platforms or death areas.  Lines were also used to create the spikes.  The sprite is made in the using circles for the head and eyes and a block for the body.  The gem is made using lines and shaping them to look like a gem. </p>
           <p class="notes">The "and", "or", and "not" operators were used in the player coding.  The OR operator was used to kill the player when touching any color that was red or grey. The NOT operator was used to have some movement in the air and for horizontal velocity when not pressing the a or d key. Finally, I used the AND operator also for horizontal velocity when not pressing the a or d key.  The Boolean logic is algorithmic programming for computer science that uses the AND, OR, or NOT operators directing computer flow for different outputs.  The number systems is a way to represent numbers that utilize base 10, binary, and hexadecimal. With base 10 we use number such as 1, 2, 3... that will reach the tens or the hundreds.  Then we can use numbers like these and convert them to other bases such as base 2 or binary where the numbers are only 0 and 1 or hexadecimal where the numbers go from 0 to 15.</p>

             <p class="accesibility">To make the website accessible for some, the site is suited for people that that have disabilities or for older visitors.  The text on the website contrast the background so that it is made easier to read for people who have trouble seeing.  I made a transcript for the audio on the website for people who have trouble hearing or are deaf.  For people who are unable to use a mouse, they can use their keyboard to traverse the site accessing the audio, links, and the video.  There is also an alt text for the image for people who are visually impaired so they can use their text-only browsers.  The links open in the same browser making it easier to use the back button to get back to the website.</p>
